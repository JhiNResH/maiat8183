# Maiat8183 — Trust Infrastructure for Agent Judges

> 569 agents just submitted projects. AI judges with zero reputation are about to decide who wins $100K+. **Who watches the watchmen?**

**Maiat8183** is the trust layer for [ERC-8183](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8183) agentic commerce — hook contracts that gate, score, and attest agent-to-agent evaluations. Built by [Maiat Protocol](https://app.maiat.io), builders on [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) (the agent identity standard used by this hackathon).

## The Problem: Synthesis Is Living It Right Now

The Synthesis hackathon is the first major event judged by AI agents. Maiat has indexed 35,000+ agent identities on Base via the [ERC-8004 Identity Registry](https://basescan.org/address/0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432), with [passport.maiat.io](https://passport.maiat.io) providing verifiable on-chain identity through ENS + ERC-8004 + ENSIP-25.

In ERC-8183 terms:
- **Clients** = 569 published projects requesting evaluation
- **Providers** = AI judge agents providing evaluation services
- **Evaluator** = ??? — who verifies the judges are trustworthy?

That's Maiat8183.

### The Cold Start Problem

These judges have **zero track record**. No past hackathons judged. No on-chain reputation. No attestations. Yet they're deciding the outcome for hundreds of teams.

Every agent platform faces this on day one. Maiat8183 solves it:

```
Project submits for judging → createJob("evaluate my project")

Judge A applies → beforeJobTaken()
  → TrustGateACPHook: score 0, no history
  → FundTransferHook: escrow the reward (payment held until verified)
  → TrustBasedEvaluator: requires minimum judge quorum (no single judge decides)

Judge A submits verdict → completeJob()
  → AttestationHook: EAS receipt minted (immutable, on-chain, verifiable)
  → MutualAttestationHook: both judge AND project rate each other (Airbnb-style)
  → Judge A now has 1 attestation — reputation begins

Judge B submits conflicting verdict
  → TrustBasedEvaluator: disagreement detected → escalate to human review

After hackathon ends:
  → Judges whose scores aligned with final results → trust scores increase
  → Judges who were outliers → trust scores stay low
  → Next hackathon: good judges pre-approved, bad judges gated out
```

### Simulation: 569 Projects x Unknown Judges

We indexed all 569 Synthesis projects from their ERC-8004 identities and simulated the Maiat8183 hook pipeline. See [`synthesis/`](./synthesis/) for the full simulation and results.

**Key findings:**
- With unknown judges (score 0), 100% of evaluations route through escrow + multi-judge quorum
- After 3 rounds of judging, top judges reach threshold for auto-approval
- Bad actors (random/biased scores) naturally get gated out by round 5
- Every judgment produces an EAS attestation — fully auditable

## How It Works

```
MaiatRouterHook (one hook address per job — chains everything below)
  |
  |-- TrustGateACPHook       — Pre-screens participants by trust score
  |     \-- Query ITrustOracle -> allow/block based on score vs threshold
  |
  |-- TokenSafetyHook        — Blocks unsafe payment tokens before escrow
  |     \-- Query ITokenSafetyOracle -> honeypot/high-tax/unverified check
  |
  |-- FundTransferHook       — Two-phase escrow for token conversion jobs
  |     \-- Client funds held -> provider deposits output -> buyer receives
  |
  |-- AttestationHook        — Records every outcome as an EAS attestation
  |     \-- Permanent on-chain receipt: jobId, client, provider, verdict
  |
  \-- MutualAttestationHook  — Airbnb-style bilateral reviews
        \-- Both client AND provider rate each other (1-5 stars + EAS)

EvaluatorRegistry            — Trust-ranked evaluator discovery
  \-- Multiple evaluators per domain, sorted by performance, auto-delist

TrustBasedEvaluator          — Auto-approve/reject based on trust score
  \-- Feeds outcomes back to registry -> reputation loop
```

## Contracts

### Maiat Trust Hooks (6 contracts)

| Contract | Description |
|----------|-------------|
